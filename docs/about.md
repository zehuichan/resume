你好，我叫陈泽辉

7年+前端开发经验，擅长并熟练使用 `vue2/3`、`taro`、`uniapp` 的开发模式，能独立开发项目，组件抽象。

在上家公司任高级前端一职，配置初中级前端3名，主要负责技术选型、项目起步的基础搭建、项目组件库的封装以及核心代码编写。

嗯，大概就是这些了。

## Introduce myself

First of all, thanks for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself, I'm glad to have this interview, I'll introduce
myself briefly now.

Hi, I am [chenzehui] and I have [8] years of experience as a senior [front-end developer].

I'm skilled in frontend frameworks like [React and Vue.js], as well as [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript]. I have also worked
with APIs and familiar with version control programs like Git or SVN. I'm a self-starter who values working in a team as
well as alone. I also pay close attention to details and aim to write legible, clean code.

In last, I was excited to find this position as an [front-end developer] at [Company] and believe that I would be a
great fit for this role. My belief is that I am the right candidate for this profile since I have the required skills
and experience. I assure you that I will give my best responsibility to [Company]. Thank you!
